1. Test Cases for Drop Down Field

Think about:

UI & functionality

Data validation

Default values

Error handling

Example areas to test:

Is the drop-down visible on the page?

Does it open on click/tap?

Are all expected options present?

Are options sorted logically (alphabetical, by category, etc.)?

Can you select one option at a time?

Does the default option match the requirements?

Does it work on all browsers/devices?

Does it behave correctly when there are many options (scrolling)?

What happens if you leave it unselected (if it’s mandatory)?
